/*
 * Historical life expectancy
 *
 * When we looked up all the people in our data set that lived more than 90 years,
 * only the latest generation in the data came out. Letâ€™s take a closer look at
 * that phenomenon.
 * Compute and output the average age of the people in the ancestry data set per 
 * century. A person is assigned to a century by taking their year of death, 
 * dividing it by 100, and rounding it up, as in Math.ceil(person.died / 100).
 * For bonus points, write a function groupBy that abstracts the grouping 
 * operation. It should accept as arguments an array and a function that computes 
 * the group for an element in the array and returns an object that maps group 
 * names to arrays of group members.
